Serial port terminal
====================

This application is a simple serial port terminal. MDI application
is capable to have many ports opened at same time. It's possible to
set up the various configurations as baudrate, stopbits, etc.
I have tested this by making loop, windows on the screen, from USB to
USB to setrial converter, Serial modem cable, USB to serial
coverter to USB and another window on the screen.
